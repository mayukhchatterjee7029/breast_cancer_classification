## 🔍 Overview

This project implements a machine learning classifier to predict whether breast cancer tumors are malignant or benign based on various cell characteristics. The model uses features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirate (FNA) of breast masses to make accurate predictions.

## 📊 Dataset

The project uses the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset, which includes:
- **569 samples** of breast cancer cases
- **30 features** describing cell characteristics
- **2 classes**: Malignant (M) and Benign (B)

Features include measurements like:
- Radius, texture, perimeter, area
- Smoothness, compactness, concavity
- Symmetry and fractal dimension

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/breast-cancer-classification.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd breast-cancer-classification
```

3. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 💻 Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook breast_cancer_clf.ipynb
```

2. Run all cells to:
   - Load and explore the dataset
   - Preprocess the data
   - Train the classification model
   - Evaluate model performance
   - View prediction results

## 📈 Model Performance
